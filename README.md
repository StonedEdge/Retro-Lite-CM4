## Description
The Retro Lite CM4 is a joint project between Dmcke5 and StonedEdge from the BitBuilt forums. The console is powered by a 4000mAh Li-Po and is designed to run with RetroPie, Lakka or Batocera images from an SD card.

### Code 
Code required to complete the handheld includes an ATtiny84 monitor script, which can be flashed via the 1.27mm pitch 6 pin header on the main Retro Lite PCB with an Arduino or similar. Code for the i2s audio amplifier, fuel gauge and OSD functionality can be compiled directly on the CM4 module from the command line. Current code is non-functional, however will be uploaded at a later date when completed. 

### CAD
The CAD files for the Retro Lite CM4 are not available or open source at this stage. Please do not ask me or Dmcke5 to release them yet as we will not do so. 

### PCB
The Retro Lite CM4 requires 4 custom designed PCBs to be installed, not including the CM4 carrier board. These include: 

a) Retro Lite CM4 AIO carrier board 
b) Retro Lite Controller PCB (Right)
c) Retro Lite Controller PCB (Left)
d) Retro Lite Button Daughterboard

### BOM (Bill of Materials) 
Link to the BoM will be added at a later stage. 
Total BoM to build the Retro Lite CM4 exceeds $250 USD. 

### Contributors 
I'd like to thank these people in no particular order for the awesome work you have done to help me complete this project. 

* Dmcke5 for designing the case assets, including machining our prototypes, code and much more. Wouldn't have been possible to complete this without you 
* YveltalGriffin for suggesting various hardware changes and reviews to PCB/schematics, as well as generally being open and willing to help 
* Juckett D, for creating the Aegis CM4 and offering tips and tricks along the way. Check out his work here: https://github.com/juckettd
