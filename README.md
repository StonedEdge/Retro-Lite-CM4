### Code 
Code required to complete the handheld includes an ATtiny84 monitor script, which can be flashed via the 1.27mm pitch 6 pin header on the main Retro Lite PCB. Code for the i2s audio amplifier, fuel gauge and OSD functionality can be compiled directly on the CM4 module from the command line.  

### CAD
The CAD files for the Retro Lite CM4 are not available or open source at this stage. Please do not ask me to release them. 

### PCB
The Retro Lite CM4 uses 4 PCBs, not including the CM4 carrier board. These include: 

a) Retro Lite CM4 AIO carrier board 
b) Retro Lite Controller PCB (Right)
c) Retro Lite Controller PCB (Left)
d) Retro Lite Button Daughterboard

### BOM (Bill of Materials) 
Link to the BoM will be added at a later stage.
