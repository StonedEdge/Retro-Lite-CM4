# Worms

The idea for the worms came from an article in Scientific American
(December 1987) called Computer Recreations: Simple special effects
illustrate the art of converting algorithms into programs written by A. K.
Dewdney

The worms use a simple algorithm to randomly change direction by a few
degrees each iteration.

Unlike the other demonstations, a transparent background layer is created by
default. The worms will crawl over the frame buffer. Press 'Esc' to exit.
