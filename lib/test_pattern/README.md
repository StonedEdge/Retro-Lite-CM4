# test_pattern

This test pattern should be familiar to anyone who has used the Raspberry
Pi. It is the same four colour square displayed when the Raspberry Pi boots.
This is a very simple demonstation of the DispmanX interface. Two layers are
created. The first layer is a black background (used to hide the frame
buffer) consisting of a single pixel that is stretched to the screen
extents. The second layer consists of four pixels (2x2) that are stretched
to the height of the screen.
